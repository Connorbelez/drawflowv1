# Build Collaboration Cutover Runbook

## Purpose

Promote the Build-local Collaboration workspace, migrate legacy Public/Internal
Notes, and activate the production feed without leaking restricted metadata or
duplicating operational records.

## Preconditions

- Deploy the collaboration schema and fluent-Convex functions.
- Run `bun x convex codegen` and `bun x tsc -p convex/tsconfig.json --noEmit`.
- Confirm the originating brokerage/lender WorkOS organization on every active
  Build in scope. Builds do not move organizations.
- Keep collaboration disabled or migration-ready until parity checks pass.

## Migration

Run `build_collaboration_migrations.runBuildCollaborationNoteBackfill`.

The migration is idempotent. Each legacy note uses
`buildNote:<legacy note id>` as `importedSourceId`:

- Public Notes become Build-wide imported Updates.
- Internal Notes become author-tier-and-higher imported Updates.
- Original author, role snapshot, body, and timestamps are preserved.
- Migration creates no notifications, Seen receipts, Action Items, or artificial
  meaningful-activity bump.

Re-running the migration must produce zero duplicate posts.

## Parity Checks

For each Build:

1. Legacy note count equals imported collaboration post count.
2. Every imported post has exactly one current revision.
3. Public and Internal visibility maps to the expected audience mode and floor.
4. A Contractor cannot read an imported Internal Note or infer its author,
   timestamp, references, or Action Items.
5. Admin, Principal Broker, Broker/Builder/Broker Staff, Builder Staff,
   Homeowner, and Contractor feed results match the approved role matrix.

## Activation

After parity:

1. Mark the tenant collaboration setting active.
2. Deploy the Details composition with Build Overview unchanged and the
   Collaboration feed beneath it.
3. Confirm Documents, Milestones, Contractors, and Draws own their canonical
   content.
4. Remove Public/Internal Notes from navigation and shared write paths.

## Rollback

Rollback is UI/configuration-only:

- disable the collaboration surface for the tenant;
- retain imported posts and audit data;
- do not delete migrated posts or restore dual writes;
- diagnose and correct the migration, then re-run the idempotent parity checks.

## Verification

```sh
bun x convex codegen
bun x tsc -p convex/tsconfig.json --noEmit
bun run test
bun run typecheck
bun run build
bun run ui:html:audit
```

Monitor authorization denials, restricted-placeholder disclosure alarms,
notification fan-out, duplicate idempotency keys, stale draft approvals,
Action Item revision conflicts, and migration parity.
